# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Todo Management Workflow

Always maintain a `todo.md` file with the following priority structure:
- **Always**: Critical tasks that must be done immediately
- **High**: Important tasks that should be completed soon
- **Medium**: Tasks that can be scheduled for later
- **Low**: Nice-to-have tasks
- **Done**: Completed tasks (keep for reference)
- **Complete**: Fully verified and tested tasks

### Required Workflow Steps
1. Always update `todo.md` after each task completion
2. Run `git add .` after each task
3. Run `git commit -m "descriptive message"` after each task

This ensures continuous progress tracking and version control of all changes.
